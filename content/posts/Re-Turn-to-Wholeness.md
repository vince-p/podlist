Integration through attitude change, environment, and community.

<!--more-->

3 Key Points:

- A common theme after a transformative experience is the calling for an attitude change. The experience is only the first step, the integration is where the real work begins.
- The environment is a critical part of integration. You canâ€™t always change your environment, but you can change your relationship to it by forming new coping mechanisms than the ones used before a transformative experience.
- Joining consciousness events, finding a therapist and looking for integration circles are all great way to not feel so ashamed or alone after a transformative experience.
